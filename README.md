# Amulet-Plugins

Welcome to **Amulet-Plugins**, where I share tools and plugins for **Minecraft editing**.  

Currently available:

- **Inventory Editor**: Quickly manage your in-game inventory—add, remove, or customize items with ease.
- **Village Editor**: Modify villager trades, inventories, and village data efficiently.

Coming soon:

- Some **C# code** for additional functionality.
- **YouTube videos** to demonstrate features—sometimes the easiest tools are the hardest to showcase!
